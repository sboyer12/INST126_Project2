# INST126_Project2

# I am creating a word guessing game for my project. I will create a word bank where the players have to guess letters to see what word it is.

Game Overview:

This game will allow you to enter with any number of players.
It will randomly choose a word out of 5 pre-programmed words and each player will rotate guessing letters of the words.
If player guesses more than one letter at a time, the program will count it as a word guess.
Once the player has done three word guess failures the game will end.
If a player guesses the word correctly then the game will end as well.
